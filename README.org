# STORY-TEMPLATE-VERSION: 4.3.0

* Semi automatic reviews

  - Learners _expect_ to have a schedule of reviews _so that_ they review only
    the minimum possible, when it's needed.  They minimize the review time vs
    knowledge mastered.

*** Definitions


** Init State

   - NNotes has no way to satisfy this expectation.



** Problem

   - Minimizing learning time is both an expectation from learers/authors and a
     claim of NNotes.  NNotes cannot avoid this one!



** End State

   - NNotes offers an optimized semi automatic review calendar to learners:
       - `automatic` because reviews are automatically scheduled wrt to users data.

       - `semi automatic` because learners can manually add/update/delete
         scheduled reviews to fit scheduling needs NNotes cannot take into
         account.
